To demo the multiplayer functionality, run the MasterServer.exe.
Open up two instances of test.exe, obtain some cards on each, and enter the "Cards Obtained" menu for both.

The Server instance should click Start Server. The client can then either find the server listed and choose Join Server , or manually connect via TCP/IP.

In order to see the other players cards, you must click "Show Cards" AFTER the two instances have connected to each other.
